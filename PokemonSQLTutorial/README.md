This directory has a rich Pokemon Sqlite database (generated by software found here: https://github.com/veekun/pokedex thanks to Veekun for creating this). It also has a bunch of sql statements that provide example queries into the database, e.g. the file gen1Moves.sql lists all the moves found in generation 1, along with the move type.

Requirements:
------------
Some sql or sqlite engine (I used sqlite3)

Usage:
------------
Pipe the .sql statements into the sqlite engine, like so: 

	$ sqlite3 pokedex.sqlite < gen1Moves.sql

Experiment with the examples and get a feel for SQL.
